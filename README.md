# PLibC - PHTNC's libC

This is a custom C Standard library that targets the PS3. I've made this project to get a better understanding on how the C standard library functions work, improve my coding skills in C and out of boredom.

I assume some people will yet again argue that we already got this and that, why reinvent the wheel, etc. etc.
Read the message above again. Also, the current provided libraries are either highly limited (EBOOT exports) or do not universally work (VSH exports)

This version should be universally available for all types of PS3 projects and is also open-source!

# Credits

PHTNC<>                   - The one who initiated the project and ports the library to the PS3 platform
Musl C Library developers - The library is mostly based off their implementation.
Unknown PS3 Homebrew Devs - Those who made some implementations of a few functions that I've found online

# THE LIBRARY IS STILL INCOMPLETE!!!

Yes, it's not fully implemented. So far, I've implemented most of the string.h functions and a small number of stdio.h and ctype.h functions. Any help would be greatly appreciated to accelerate development speed.
